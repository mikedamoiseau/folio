# Fetch the MOBI test corpus used by folio-core's fixture-gated tests.
#
# The corpus lives under `src-tauri/test-fixtures/` (gitignored) and is
# pulled on demand rather than checked in — MOBI files are a few hundred
# KB each, but keeping a binary corpus in git quickly becomes a
# licensing and reviewability headache. Everything fetched here is in
# the public domain (Project Gutenberg).
#
# Files produced:
#   src-tauri/test-fixtures/alice.mobi         — KF8 (AZW3 / file version 8)
#   src-tauri/test-fixtures/alice-legacy.mobi  — legacy Mobipocket (version 6)
#
# Idempotent: an existing file with matching name is left alone so re-running
# the script after a partial network failure only fetches what's missing.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/fetch-mobi-test-corpus.sh
#   FORCE=1 ./scripts/fetch-mobi-test-corpus.sh   # re-download existing files

# Project Gutenberg IDs and file slugs. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
# (PG #11) is the canonical test book — it has illustrations, a cover,
# multiple chapters, and is small enough to keep fixture runs fast.
#
# Project Gutenberg publishes both the KF8 and legacy variants under
# different suffixes. We keep the mapping explicit so a broken upstream
# URL shows up here rather than as a cryptic test failure.
# The `-kf8` suffix is load-bearing: `pg11-images.mobi` and
# `pg11-images-kf8.mobi` both resolve 200 OK at Gutenberg, but only the
# latter is KF8 / file-version 8 — the unsuffixed URL returns legacy
# Mobipocket v6 wrapped in a slightly newer header. The KF8 variant is
# what we actually need to exercise the AZW3 code paths, so we fetch
# the `-kf8` URL by name rather than relying on the redirect chain.
#
# Format: `<name>|<url>|<sha256>`. The hash pins fixture content so a
# silent upstream republish (re-encoded with a new tool chain, for
# example) surfaces as a checksum failure rather than a mysterious
# smoke-test regression. Re-run with `FORCE=1` and update the hash
# deliberately when Project Gutenberg reissues a file.
