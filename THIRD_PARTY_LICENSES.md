# Third-Party Licenses

Folio is released under the MIT License (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)). It links
against or bundles the following third-party components. Each entry below
credits the upstream project, states how Folio uses it, and points at the
canonical license text.

The full text of every license referenced here is available at
<https://opensource.org/licenses> and mirrored by the upstream projects.

Rust crate dependencies are enumerated with their licenses in
[`Cargo.lock`](./Cargo.lock); JavaScript dependencies in
[`package-lock.json`](./package-lock.json). The entries below call out only
the components that affect distribution — native libraries that Folio links
to or ships in its release artifacts.

## libmobi

- **Upstream:** <https://github.com/bfabiszewski/libmobi>
- **License:** GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 or later (LGPL-3.0-or-later)
- **License text:** <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>
- **How Folio uses it:** Folio links against libmobi to parse MOBI / AZW /
  AZW3 (KF8) ebook files. The link mode differs by platform — see
  *Distribution* below. Enabled when Folio is built with the `mobi` cargo
  feature.
- **Platform availability:** MOBI support is compiled into **Linux**,
  **arm64 (Apple Silicon) macOS**, and **Windows** release builds. The
  **x86_64 (Intel) macOS** build is the only release that ships without
  MOBI support — Homebrew on the macos-latest CI runner installs an
  arm64-only libmobi.dylib that cannot be linked into an x86_64 target.

### Distribution

Folio's link mode for libmobi is platform-specific:

- **Linux** and **arm64 macOS**: libmobi is **dynamically linked** at
  process load time. The release binaries do **not** ship libmobi —
  end users **must install libmobi before first launch**, otherwise the
  app fails to start (not just MOBI open). Install from the system
  package manager:
  - macOS (Apple Silicon): `brew install libmobi`
  - Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libmobi0` (the `.deb` package
    declares this as a dependency, so a typical `apt install` of Folio
    pulls libmobi in automatically)
  - Fedora / RHEL: `sudo dnf install libmobi`

- **Windows**: libmobi is **statically linked** into `folio.exe`. The
  Tauri bundler does not place sibling DLLs where the OS loader expects
  them at process start, so the Windows build of libmobi is produced as
  a self-contained `mobi.lib` static archive (CMake configured with
  `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`, `USE_ZLIB=OFF`, `USE_LIBXML2=OFF`) and baked
  directly into the executable. End users do **not** install libmobi
  separately on Windows.

### LGPL compliance notes

LGPL v3+ permits both dynamic and static linking from MIT-licensed
applications, subject to the obligations below. The dynamic and static
paths satisfy the *relinking* obligation differently; both are addressed.

1. **Attribution.** This file and the in-app About screen identify
   libmobi, its license, and its upstream source.
2. **License availability.** The LGPL v3 text is available at the link
   above and is reproduced in the upstream libmobi repository's
   `COPYING` file.
3. **Source availability.** libmobi's source is published on GitHub at
   the upstream URL. The exact commit Folio links against is pinned by
   `LIBMOBI_VERSION` in
   [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
   so any release can be matched to the specific upstream revision.
   Folio does not carry a fork or apply patches.
4. **Relinking.**
   - **Linux / arm64 macOS (dynamic):** Users may replace the shipped
     shared library with their own compatible build of libmobi without
     modifying or rebuilding Folio. No further action is required from
     the application beyond the dynamic-library layout.
   - **Windows (static):** LGPL §6 requires that recipients be able to
     re-link Folio against a modified libmobi. The complete chain
     needed for this is published openly:
     - Folio's source is on GitHub under MIT — see [the repository root](./).
     - The libmobi commit Folio statically links is pinned by SHA in
       `release.yml` (see *Source availability* above) and the exact
       CMake recipe used to produce the static archive is in the
       same workflow file (`Build libmobi (Windows)` step).
     - A user wishing to substitute a modified libmobi can rebuild
       Folio from source against a different libmobi by changing the
       pinned SHA (or by replacing `.libmobi-windows/lib/mobi.lib`
       in the build tree before `cargo build`) and re-running the
       Tauri build. The same `LIBMOBI_INCLUDE_DIR` / `LIBMOBI_LIB_DIR`
       env vars used by CI are honoured by `folio-core/build.rs`.

     If you need pre-built object files (`.obj`) or the unmodified
     `mobi.lib` Folio shipped a particular Windows release with, open
     an issue on the GitHub repository and we will provide them.
5. **Modifications.** Folio does not modify libmobi. If that ever
   changes, the modified source will be published alongside the
   release.

## pdfium (Chromium PDF engine)

- **Upstream:** <https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/>
- **Binary distribution:** <https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries>
- **License:** BSD-3-Clause (Folio uses the Chromium-style "New BSD" license
  text)
- **License text:** <https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/refs/heads/main/LICENSE>
- **How Folio uses it:** Dynamically linked to render PDF pages into
  bitmaps for the Reader. Bindings are provided by the
  [`pdfium-render`](https://crates.io/crates/pdfium-render) Rust crate.
- **Distribution:** Release builds bundle the pdfium shared library in
  `src-tauri/resources/`, fetched at build time by
  [`scripts/download-pdfium.sh`](./scripts/download-pdfium.sh).

---

## unrar / unrar_sys

- **Upstream:** <https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm> (via the
  [`unrar`](https://crates.io/crates/unrar) Rust crate)
- **License:** The UnRAR source is distributed under the **UnRAR license**,
  which permits use for decompression but explicitly forbids using the
  source to develop RAR-compatible compression tools. Folio only reads RAR
  / CBR archives, so this restriction is not at issue.
- **License text:** Included in the upstream source and reproduced in the
  `unrar_sys` crate.
- **How Folio uses it:** Statically linked for CBR (comic book RAR) archive
  support.
