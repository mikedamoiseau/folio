// Item 9 (PWA): minimal service worker — cache-first for the static app
// shell only. Reading content and API data are never cached (freshness/auth
// complexity isn't worth it for v1; see docs/web-ui-improvements.md Item 9).
//
// Finding 9: CACHE_VERSION must embed a short content hash of the shell
// assets (index.html + app.js + app.css + manifest.json) — enforced by
// `cache_version_embeds_shell_asset_content_hash` in mod.rs, which fails CI
// with the expected hash whenever one of those files changes without this
// being regenerated to match. Don't hand-edit the version without re-running
// that test.
//
// SHELL_ASSETS mirrors `web_ui::PUBLIC_SHELL_ASSETS` in web_ui.rs (Finding
// 11) — that's the source of truth for which paths are public/unauthed on
// the Rust side; keep this array in sync with it by hand (a JS file can't
// import a Rust const), plus `/favicon.ico` which isn't a distinct shell
// asset worth precaching separately from `/favicon.png`.
//
// Secure-context caveat: service workers only register on secure contexts
// (https, or http://localhost). Folio's primary LAN use case — a phone
// hitting http://192.168.x.x:7788 — is plain HTTP and NOT a secure context,
// so the service worker will not register there and this cache never
// activates; app.js's registration call is feature-detected/try-catched so
// this is silent, not an error. The manifest + icons still work for iOS
// Safari "Add to Home Screen" over plain HTTP.
